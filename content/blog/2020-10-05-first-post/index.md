I used to have a blog, well technically I still have it as of today. It is setup with Wordpress powered by Bluehost. It was okay for a while. I wasn't quite consistent with the content, post some answers on LeetCode, share some notes on books that I have read etc. It may seem weird that I am writing another blog now. If I want to write it, why not use the one I already have, considering the server and domain name have been paid. Maybe I start with why I started writing blog in the first place.

## Why

### Learn

Time and time again, one thing keeps coming up whenever I learn something, whether from books/blogs/videos, the best way to learn is to teach. It is something I couldn't agree more. Not only it acts as a revision for yourself on the subject, it also challenges your understanding. If you want to teach someone something, you have to understand the subject really well. I feel that my learning has not been truly effective. Blogging may help to reinforce what I have learned.

I just finished a course called "Start Learning Software Architecture From Zero" by Lee YunHua(You can find the course on Geekbang [here](https://time.geekbang.org/column/intro/81)). He mentioned the same thing as well at the end of the lesson. So it is also a catalyst to my blog reborn.

### Share

To be honest, I don't think anyone would read whatever I have to share. There are plenty of amazing resources out there, free for everyone. By a slim chance that they want to, I don't think they can find it in the first place. Still, there is a part of me wanting to share. It's kind of hard to explain, but if I can even just help a few people in some way, my blog would have served its purpose.

## Why Migrate

When I first started, I want to focus on writing content. I could have written on Medium or some other platform, but then I prefer a safe/personal space for me to write. However, I have a lot of issues regarding speed and stability. Imagine the admin portal keeps loading when you want to write something. It kinda hurt the experience. Granted, I sign up the cheapest plan, also there are configurations that can be done (which I did, like caching) to optimize it. Still, it can be distracting.

## End Note

I have heard of Gatsby for a long time, but never have an opportunity to actually try it. I guess this is the perfect time to do it! Hopefully I can be more consistent this time. I still have much to learn, hopefully one day I can become the teacher.
